Notes from Avik Mondal, 6/22/2021

1) for new users to Pleiades and Hector's xmitgcm3 environment, there are a few details that are 
important to note for getting Mit_xr_coas_with_tides.py to work properly. First, the code seems to
not work with the most up to date version of pyresample and pyproj. Downgrade your pyresample to 
v1.16.0 and downgrade your pyproj to v1.9.6.

2) Note, when I tried to use this code, I had added some extra libraries to Hector's xmitgcm3.yml environment.
 These libraries include zarr, holoviews, hdf5, bokeh, and pyviz. These are the only libraries I can remember
adding and I'm not sure if they would have any conflicts with pyproj or pyresample - but here they are just in case. 

3) the exact order of how you do this might matter. I downgraded pyproj first to v1.9.6 ("conda remove pyproj",
then "conda install -c conda-forge pyproj==1.9.6". Alternatively, "pip install pyproj==1.9.6" make work for you).
After that, I repeated the same process but for pyresample. Then I repeated the step "conda install -c 
conda-forge pyproj." This seemed to get the script working.
