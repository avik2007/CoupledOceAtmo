Much of this will probably be copied straight from Paige's own files - I'll supplement with my conclusions about what the equations mean for my data analysis."

Using biharmonic viscosity seems to encourage \"scale selectivity.\" -- http://mitgcm.org/public/r2_manual/final/online_documents/node86.html#SECTION003211700000000000000. "
